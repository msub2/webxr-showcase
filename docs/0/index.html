        <p>
          Getting started with WebXR development requires, at bare minimum, a web
          browser and a code editor. The only major browsers currently without full WebXR
          support are Firefox and Safari, but any Chromium-based browser will do well
          (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc). For code editing, a popular choice is 
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, but if you already have a 
          preferred editor feel free to use that instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some web frameworks, you may not necessarily even need a separate
          code editor. If it's purely based on HTML and JavaScript, you can use online services
          like <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> or <a href="https://codepen.io">Codepen</a>
          that let you host and edit web projects directly on their site.

        <template id="A-Frame">
          <p>
            To get started with A-Frame, all you need to do is load A-Frame
            through a &lt;script&gt; tag. You can copy and paste the
            latest version below:
          </p>
          <latest-script-tag for="aframe"></latest-script-tag>
          <p>If you're using Node.js, you can add it through NPM:</p>
          <pre><code>npm install aframe</code></pre>
          <p>
            With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in
            A-Frame!
          </p>

        <template id="babylon.js">
          <p>
            To get started with babylon.js, all you need to do is include
            babylon.js through a &lt;script&gt; tag. You can copy and paste the
            latest version below:
          </p>
          <latest-script-tag for="babylon"></latest-script-tag>

            babylon.js!
          </p>
        </template>

        <template id="Godot">
          <p>
            To get started with Godot, you first need to download the engine, which
            you can get at the official site
            <a href="https://godotengine.org/download">here</a>. You just need the
            standard version.
          </p>

        <template id="JanusWeb">
          <p>
            To get started with JanusWeb, all that's needed is to include
            janusweb.js through a &lt;script&gt; tag. You can copy and paste the
            latest one below:
          </p>
          <latest-script-tag for="janusweb"></latest-script-tag>
          <p>
            With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in
            JanusWeb!
          </p>
        </template>

        <template id="p5.xr">
          <p>
            To get started with p5.xr, all you need to do is include both p5.js and p5.xr in
            &lt;script&gt; tags. You can copy and paste the latest version of both below:
          </p>
          <latest-script-tag for="p5xr"></latest-script-tag>
          <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in p5.xr!</p>
        </template>

        <template id="PlayCanvas">
          <p>
            To get started with PlayCanvas, you first need to create an account on the
            <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">PlayCanvas website</a>. Once you do, you'll be
            able to create PlayCanvas projects in their entirely web-based editor. It's also
            possible to create PlayCanvas projects without using the web editor, but this will
            be covered more in the future.
          </p>
          <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in PlayCanvas!</p>
        </template>

        <template id="React XR">
          <p>To get started with React XR, install both react-three-fiber and React XR through NPM:</p>
          <pre><code>npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/xr</code></pre>
          <p>
            These tutorials will assume you already have at least some familiarity with React,
            so details such as build tools will be left to your discretion. For reference, the React XR projects on this site
            will make use of <a href="https://github.com/nano-react-app/nano-react-app">nano-react-app</a>,
            which uses Vite under the hood, but feel free to choose whatever you are most familiar with (Webpack, Rollup, etc).

        <template id="Rogue Engine">
          <p>To get started with Rogue Engine, download it from the official site <a href="https://rogueengine.io/">here</a>.</p>
          <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in Rogue Engine!</p>
        </template>

        <template id="three.js">
          <p>
            To get started with three.js, you can load it through a script tag, but you'll need to
            load it with type="module", as three.js uses ES modules. You can place this &lt;script&gt;
            tag in your &lt;body&gt; to begin:
          </p>
          <latest-script-tag for="threejs"></latest-script-tag>
          <p>If you're using Node.js, you can add it through NPM:</p>
          <pre><code>npm install three</code></pre>
          <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in three.js!</p>
        </template>

        <template id="Unity">
          <p>
            To get started with Unity, download Unity Hub from the
            <a href="https://unity.com/download">official website.</a> Once it's installed,
            select a version of Unity to install, making sure you add WebGL support before initiating the install. 
            These examples will use the latest LTS version (currently Unity 2020), but you should be able to 
            recreate these projects on newer or older versions as well, as long as they are newer than Unity 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we have Unity Hub and a version of Unity installed with WebGL support, we need to use an exporter.
            The original WebXR exporter for Unity was previously maintained by Mozilla, but this is sadly no longer
            the case. Instead, we must rely on packages from the community. Two popular choices are
            <a href="https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export">this one</a> from De-Panther and 
            <a href="https://github.com/Rufus31415/Simple-WebXR-Unity">this one</a> from Rufus31415. These examples
            will use De-Panther's, but feel free to experiment and see which one you prefer.
          </p>
          <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in Unity!</p>

        <template id="Verge3D">
          <p>
            To get started with Verge3D, download it from the 
            <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/get-verge3d/">official website</a>. You'll also need to be using either
            Blender, 3DS Max, or Maya, as Verge3D functions as an integration with your 3D modeling software.

        <template id="Wonderland Engine">
          <p>
            To get started with Wonderland Engine, download it from the
            <a href="https://wonderlandengine.com/downloads">official website.</a> You'll need to create a free account,
            after which you'll be able to get a license key to enter in the first time you launch the engine.
          </p>
          <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in Wonderland Engine!</p>
