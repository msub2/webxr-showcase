      <h1>0 - Getting Started</h1>
      <p>
        Getting started with WebXR development requires, at bare minimum, a web
        browser and a code editor. The only major browsers currently without full WebXR
        support are Firefox and Safari, but any Chromium-based browser will do well
        (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc). For code editing, a popular choice is 
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, but if you already have a 
        preferred editor feel free to use that instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some web frameworks, you may not necessarily even need a separate
        code editor. If it's purely based on HTML and JavaScript, you can use online services
        like <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> or <a href="https://codepen.io">Codepen</a>
        that let you host and edit web projects directly on their site.

      <template id="A-Frame">
        <p>
          To get started with A-Frame, all you need to do is load A-Frame
          through a &lt;script&gt; tag. You can copy and paste the
          latest version below:
        </p>
        <latest-script-tag for="aframe"></latest-script-tag>
        <p>If you're using Node.js, you can add it through NPM:</p>
        <code>npm install aframe</code>
        <p>
          With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in
          A-Frame!

      <template id="babylon.js">
        <p>
          To get started with babylon.js, all you need to do is include
          babylon.js through a &lt;script&gt; tag. You can copy and paste the
          latest version below:
        </p>
        <latest-script-tag for="babylon"></latest-script-tag>
        <p>If you're using Node.js, you can add it through NPM:</p>
        <code>npm install babylonjs</code>
        <p>
          With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in
          babylon.js!

      <template id="Godot">
        <p>
          To get started with Godot, you first need to download the engine, which
          you can get at the official site
          <a href="https://godotengine.org/download">here</a>. You just need the
          standard version.
        </p>

      </template>

      <template id="JanusWeb">
        <p>
          To get started with JanusWeb, all that's needed is to include
          janusweb.js through a &lt;script&gt; tag. You can copy and paste the
          latest one below:
        </p>
        <latest-script-tag for="janusweb"></latest-script-tag>
        <p>
          With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in
          JanusWeb!

      <template id="LÖVR">
        <p>
          To get started with LÖVR, you first need to download the framework, which you can get
          at the official site <a href="https://lovr.org/downloads">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to serve LÖVR content on the web, you'll also need an archiver like WinZip, 
          7-Zip, or WinRAR to bundle your app's contents together, as well as some generated files
          for the HTML and JavaScript. While you can generate these files yourself by following
          the instructions <a href="https://lovr.org/docs/Compiling">here</a>, for simplicity
          I've pre-generated the files myself based on the latest stable build, which you can
          download <a href="#">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in LÖVR!</p>

      <template id="nunuStudio">
        <p>
          To get started with nunuStudio, all you actually need is a web browser, as it has both
          a native and a web-based editor. While you can access both versions of the editor
          <a href="https://www.nunustudio.org/download">here</a>, I suggest just going with the 
          web editor, as it is more likely to be up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in nunuStudio!</p>
      </template>

      <template id="p5.xr">
        <p>
          To get started with p5.xr, all you need to do is include both p5.js and p5.xr in
          &lt;script&gt; tags. You can copy and paste the latest version of both below:
        </p>
        <latest-script-tag for="p5xr"></latest-script-tag>
        <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in p5.xr!</p>
      </template>

      <template id="Playcanvas">
        <p>
          To get started with Playcanvas, you first need to create an account on the
          <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">Playcanvas website</a>. Once you do, you'll be
          able to create Playcanvas projects in their entirely web-based editor. It's also
          possible to create Playcanvas projects without using the web editor, but this will
          be covered more in the future.
        </p>

      <template id="Sumerian">
        <p>
          To get started with Sumerian, you'll need to create an 
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> account. Once you do, you'll
          be able to create Sumerian projects.

      <template id="three.js">
        <p>
          To get started with three.js, you can load it through a script tag, but you'll need to
          load it with type="module", as three.js uses ES modules. You can place this &lt;script&gt;
          tag in your &lt;body&gt; to begin:
        </p>
        <latest-script-tag for="threejs"></latest-script-tag>
        <p>If you're using Node.js, you can add it through NPM:</p>
        <code>npm install three</code>
        <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in three.js!</p>

      <template id="Unity">
        <p>
          To get started with Unity, download Unity Hub from the
          <a href="https://unity.com/download">official website.</a> Once it's installed,
          select a version of Unity to install, making sure you add WebGL support before initiating the install. 
          These examples will use the latest LTS version (currently Unity 2020), but you should be able to 
          recreate these projects on newer or older versions as well, as long as they are newer than Unity 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we have Unity Hub and a version of Unity installed with WebGL support, we need to use an exporter.
          The original WebXR exporter for Unity was previously maintained by Mozilla, but this is sadly no longer
          the case. Instead, we must rely on packages from the community. Two popular choices are
          <a href="https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export">this one</a> from De-Panther and 
          <a href="https://github.com/Rufus31415/Simple-WebXR-Unity">this one</a> from Rufus31415. These examples
          will use De-Panther's, but feel free to experiment and see which one you prefer.
        </p>

      <template id="Verge3D">
        <p>
          To get started with Verge3D, download it from the 
          <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/get-verge3d/">official website</a>. You'll also need to be using either
          Blender, 3DS Max, or Maya, as Verge3D functions as an integration with your 3D modeling software.

      <template id="Wonderland Engine">
        <p>
          To get started with Wonderland Engine, download it from the
          <a href="https://wonderlandengine.com/downloads">official website.</a> You'll need to create a free account,
          after which you'll be able to get a license key to enter in the first time you launch the engine.
        </p>
        <p>With that out of the way, we can move on to creating our Hello World in Wonderland Engine!</p>
