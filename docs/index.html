# WebXR Showcase

This repository serves to demonstrate the similarities and differences between different WebXR engines, frameworks, and
libraries by constructing near-identical projects between all of them. The site will be organized by projects, from
which you can view a demo and the implementation of that project in any of the following:

- A-Frame
- babylon.js
- Godot
- JanusWeb
- LOVR
- nunuStudio
- p5.xr
- Playcanvas
- Sumerian
- three.js
- Unity
- Verge3D
- Wonderland Engine
