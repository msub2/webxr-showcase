# AWS

Given the nature of AWS, I'm not able to directly share the project, though you can view it at <https://eb2248a5ac72401888734fba31841701.us-east-2.sumerian.aws/>?. Instead, I can describe how the project was made.

- Import the VR Asset Pack from Import Assets
- Create a plane from Create Entity, then scale it up by 10, rotate it, and assign its material to be the color green.
- Set the background color to be blue from the Environment tab on the right sidebar.
- Drag the VRCameraRig from the VR Asset Pack into the scene.
- Open the VRCameraRig component on the entity and check "Current VRCameraRig" to enable it.
