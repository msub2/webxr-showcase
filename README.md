# WebXR Showcase

This repository aims to showcase several example WebXR projects in as many engines/frameworks as possible, both to showcase the differences between them as well as for my own learning.

The examples are separated by folders, within which are subfolders pertaining to each engine/framework.

In cases where a project for an engine/framework cannot easily be added to Github, a public link to the project will be provided instead.

## List of WebXR engines/frameworks included here
